## Documentation for Project Improvement

This documentation outlines suggested improvements for the Athena project in the Open Infra repository. Each suggestion is accompanied by an explanation of why the improvement is recommended and guidance on how to implement it.

### 1. **Folder Structure in README**

**Why:** A clear folder structure section in the README provides an immediate understanding of the project layout, helping users navigate the repository efficiently.

**How to Implement:**

Add a new section at the beginning of the README named "Folder Structure" and list the key folders and their purposes. Use a bullet-point format for readability.

```markdown
# Folder Structure

- **pegasus:** Submodule for the Pegasus microservice.
- **.terraform.lock.hcl:** Terraform version lock.
- **configuration.sh:** Script for local environment setup.
- **main.tf:** Main Terraform configurations.
- **pegasus.Dockerfile:** Dockerfile for the Pegasus microservice.
- **terraform.tfvars:** Environment-specific variables.
- **variables.tf:** Terraform variables definition.
```

### 2. **Getting Started Section**

**Why:** A concise "Getting Started" section guides users on the initial steps to set up and use the project, improving the onboarding experience.

**How to Implement:**

Add a new section, "Getting Started," with step-by-step instructions on cloning the repository, initializing submodules, navigating to the Athena project, and running the local environment setup script.

```markdown
# Getting Started

To use the local environment of the Athena project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone and access the Open Infra repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CRFLuiz/open-infra.git
    cd open-infra/
    ```

2. **Download submodules:**
    ```bash
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```

3. **Navigate to the Athena project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd terraform/athena
    ```

4. **Configure the local environment:**
    ```bash
    ./configuration.sh
    ```

5. **Run Terraform:**
    ```bash
    terraform init
    terraform plan -var-file="local.tfvars"
    terraform apply -var-file="local.tfvars"
    ```
### 3. **Documentation for Terraform Configurations**

**Why:** Detailed documentation for Terraform configurations provides clarity on key files and their purposes.

**How to Implement:**

Expand on the existing "Terraform Configurations" section, including information about `.terraform.lock.hcl`, `main.tf`, `pegasus.Dockerfile`, `terraform.tfvars`, and `variables.tf`. Explain the role and significance of each file.

```markdown
# Terraform Configurations

The Athena project uses Terraform to provision the local infrastructure. Here are details about the main configurations.

## Terraform Lock and Main Configurations

- **.terraform.lock.hcl:** This file contains the Terraform version lock. Make sure to review this file before making significant changes to Terraform configurations.

- **main.tf:** The main Terraform configuration file where specific settings for the local environment are defined.

## Pegasus Dockerfile

- **pegasus.Dockerfile:** This Dockerfile is used to build the Docker image for the Pegasus microservice. Make sure to review and customize as needed.

## Variables Terraform

- **terraform.tfvars:** This file contains environment-specific variables. Before running Terraform, make sure to review and provide the necessary values.

- **variables.tf:** In this file, Terraform variables are defined. Make sure to review if adjustments to variables are needed.
```

### 4. **Contributing Section**

**Why:** A dedicated "Contributing" section encourages collaboration by providing a clear guide on how users can contribute to the project.

**How to Implement:**

Add a "Contributing" section to the README with step-by-step instructions on forking, creating a branch, making changes, and opening pull requests.

```markdown
# Contributing

We love to receive contributions! Follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your changes: `git checkout -b my-contribution`.
3. Make desired changes and commit: `git commit -m "My contribution"`.
4. Push to your fork: `git push origin my-contribution`.
5. Open a pull request for review.

Make sure to include details about your changes, especially if you are contributing to the Pegasus submodule.
```

### 5. **License Section**

**Why:** A license section in the README provides clarity on how the project can be used and contributes to legal compliance.

**How to Implement:**

Add a "License" section at the end of the README, including information about the project's licensing terms.

```markdown
## License

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](../../LICENSE). If you do not agree with the terms of this license, do not contribute or use the project.
```

### 6. **Update Submodule Information in README**

**Why:** Including information about submodules in the README ensures transparency and helps users understand how to interact with submodule repositories.

**How to Implement:**

Create a new section called "Submodules" and provide details about the structure of each submodule, with a specific focus on the Pegasus submodule.

```markdown
# Submodules

Submodules are repositories for microservices related to the Athena project. You can customize as needed and see real-time updates using the local environment.

## Submodule Structure

- **Pegasus:** [CRFLuiz/pegasus](https://github.com/CRFLuiz/pegasus)
- **Dockerfile:** The specific Dockerfile to build the Docker image for the Pegasus microservice. There should be one within each submodule.
```

### Conclusion

By implementing these improvements, the README will become more informative and user-friendly. Feel free to adjust the suggestions based on your preferences and specific project requirements.
